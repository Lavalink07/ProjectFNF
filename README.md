Go [here](https://github.com/l1ttleO/ProjectFNF/releases/latest) and download the appropriate version for your OS

## Building:
**You must have the most up-to-date version of Haxe (you *cannot* compile using 4.1.5)**

Follow the [Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin#build-instructions)
After this you will need to install LuaJIT (run `haxelib install linc_luajit` in a Command Prompt/Terminal)
